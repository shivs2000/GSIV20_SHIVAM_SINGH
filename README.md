# MOVIEZ APP

simple react -app using movidb Api

## HOW TO RUN

### `npm start`

##  TESTING 
Although I didn't used jest or detox because of time constraint but i've run this in selenium ide .

#### HOW TO USE SELENIUM IDE
1) DOWNLOAD SELENIUM EXTENSION IN CHROME  
2) OPEN THAT AND OPEN THIS SELENIUM FOLDER .SIDE FILE INTO IT
3) RUN THAT TEST
4) IT WILL RUN AUTOMATICALLY

## CHALLENGES I'VE DONE WELL
1) I'VE USED react-infinite-scroll-componet ,easy to use and comes in handy instead of using javascript dom window function.
2) For ui i've used material-ui a real time saver instead of using normal css.
3) For searching inputbase from material-ui was really handy it handled input amazingly instead of normal input or text input where input and search button is handled.
4) For infinite movies, cards were used with less efforts and placing images into media and contents into card content.
5) For routing to description of the card i used routing parameters although it can be done through redux too but it was easy and clean.


## IF i HAD MORE TIME
1) Most important one if i had more time i would have used jest for testing although that's new for me.
2) i would have changed that list unique key warning that is appearing because of duplicate values in db.Maybe by fetching unique movies_by_id and pushing in array
3) Although application is not breaking at any point but still there are small changes i could've done in going back functionality of listpage.

## FEEDBACK
1)The using of redux was good but there's not much use of redux in here because global variables are not needed much so functionalities like login through firebase is good to     test redux.
